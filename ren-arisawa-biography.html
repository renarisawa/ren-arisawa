    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p class="lead">Ren Arisawa (b. 1990, ) is a contemporary artist currently based in Paris.<br><br>
    After losing their mother at a young age, drawing became a quiet refuge—an early way to understand grief and give shape to unspoken feelings.<br><br>
    They once aspired to study at Tokyo University of the Arts, Japan’s most prestigious art institution, but an unforeseen accident forced them to abandon that path. Later, they relocated to France, where they gradually developed their own artistic language while immersing themselves in the creative environment of Paris.<br><br>
    Their practice spans painting, sculpture, and contemporary art. In addition to painting, Ren explores sculptural forms and contemporary expressions, including experimental projects involving hand-painted objects that merge collectible design with fine art sensibilities.<br><br>
    Their work often explores memory, stillness, and transformation through layered materials, transparency, and minimal composition—capturing emotional depth through subtle shifts in form.</p>
